# prefix-hex

The `prefix-hex` crates offers encoding and decoding of hex strings with a `0x` prefix.

Its API aims to mimic that of the [`hex`](https://docs.rs/hex/latest/hex/) crate, which we also use internally.

This crate is compatible with the hex encoding rules of
the [Ethereum RPC API](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#hex-value-encoding).
